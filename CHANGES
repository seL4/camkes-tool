camkes-3.2.0 2018-01-17
Using seL4 version 8.0.0

= Changes =
 * New ADL Syntax: Allow struct elements to have defaults.
    See the following ADL files for examples of Struct and Attribute behavior.
    https://github.com/SEL4PROJ/rumprun/blob/master/platform/sel4/camkes/rumprun.camkes
    https://github.com/seL4/camkes/tree/master/apps/structs
    https://github.com/seL4/camkes/tree/master/apps/attributes
 * Added experimental Rumprun support:
    This functionality is experimental and may not work as expected.  See the following examples:
    https://github.com/seL4/camkes/tree/master/apps/rumprun_ethernet
    https://github.com/seL4/camkes/tree/master/apps/rumprun_hello
    https://github.com/seL4/camkes/tree/master/apps/rumprun_pthreads
    https://github.com/seL4/camkes/tree/master/apps/rumprun_rust
    More information about the Rumprun unikernel on seL4 can be found here:

 * New Templates: Remote GDB debugging support
    On ia32 platforms a GDB server can be used to debug a component using the GDB server remote serial protocol.
    documentation: https://github.com/seL4/camkes-tool/blob/master/docs/DEBUG.md
 * Added "hardware_cached" attribute to hardware dataports
    This feature had been added to camkes-2.x.x but hadn't been forward ported to camkes-3.x.x.
    documentation: https://github.com/seL4/camkes-tool/blob/master/docs/index.md#cached-hardware-dataports

= Known issues =
 * Hardware dataports that are large enough to use larger frame sizes are currently broken.  There is an issue with 
large frame promotion and hardware dataports where the capDL loader is unable to map the promoted memory. This can be 
demonstrated by running the testhwdataportlrgpages app on either arm_testhwdataportlrgpages_defconfig or 
x86_testhwdataportlrgpages_defconfig configurations. If this functionality is required, hold off upgrading until this 
issue is fixed.

= Upgrade notes =
 * ADL files: ADL syntax changes in this release should not break any existing ADL files.
 * Templates: 
 	seL4HardwareMMIO template now has an option to map hardware memory as cached.  The default setting is uncached 
which is the same as the old behaviour.
