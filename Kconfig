    config CAMKES_DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE
    int "Component stack size"
    default 16384
    range 1 1073741824 # <-- 2^30
    help
        Stack size to allocate per-component, in bytes. Note that this value
        should be page-aligned. If not, it will be rounded up.

    config CAMKES_USE_EXTERNAL_OBJDUMP
    bool "Call out to objdump for ELF information"
    default n
    help
        Instead of using the internal ELF parsing functionality, call out to
        your toolchain's objdump to perform required operations. This is much
        more fragile than using internal functionality, but can provide a
        performance boost in compilation times.

    choice
    prompt "Compilation cache"
    default CAMKES_CACHE_OFF
    help
        Select the mode of operation of the compilation cache. This cache
        stores results of previous code generation using the same configuration
        and uses this to speed up subsequent invocations.

    config CAMKES_CACHE_OFF
    bool "off"

    config CAMKES_CACHE_READWRITE
    bool "read/write"

    config CAMKES_CACHE_READONLY
    bool "read-only"

    config CAMKES_CACHE_WRITEONLY
    bool "write-only"

    endchoice

    config CAMKES_CPP
    bool "Pre-process with CPP"
    default n
    help
        Run CPP on the input specification(s) before parsing them into an AST.
        This can allow you to write parameterised specs in the case of more
        complex systems.

    config CAMKES_DEBUG_MALLOC
    bool "Enable allocation debugging"
    default n
    help
        This option instruments memory allocation functions to catch heap
        corruption. Use this for debugging dynamic memory problems.

    config CAMKES_DEBUG_POST_RENDER_EDIT
    bool "Allow editing each template after rendering"
    default n
    help
        After each template is rendered, you will be prompted as to whether you
        want to edit the rendered output before the runner exits. If you choose
        to do so, the output will be opened in the editor determined by the
        value of your environment variable EDITOR.

    config CAMKES_SYSLIB
    string "Name of C stdlib syscall backing library"
    default sel4muslccamkes
    help
        This option sets the name of the backing library which will be linked with camkes
        components. This defaults to sel4muslcsys, which is a minimal syscall library for
        muslc.

    config CAMKES_OPTIMISATION_RPC_LOCK_ELISION
    bool "Optimisation: RPC lock elision"
    default y
    help
        Detect when it is safe to exclude locking operations in the seL4RPC connector and
        automatically do so. This is an optimisation that can improve the performance of
        this connector.

    config CAMKES_OPTIMISATION_CALL_LEAVE_REPLY_CAP
    bool "Optimisation: Leave reply cap in place"
    default y
    help
        Detect scenarios where a reply cap obtained when in an seL4RPCCall
        connector can never be overwritten, and operate on it in place instead
        of saving it to a free cap slot. This is an optimisation that can
        improve the performance of the seL4RPCCall connector. Under the right
        conditions, with this optimisation enabled, it is possible to hit the
        IPC fastpath on return.

    config CAMKES_OPTIMISATION_SPECIALISE_SYSCALL_STUBS
    bool "Optimisation: Specialise syscall stubs"
    default y
    help
        Detect when glue code overhead could be reduced with a custom syscall
        stub and generate and use this instead of the libsel4 stubs. This does
        not affect whether a given IPC will hit the fastpath, but it does
        reduce the userlevel overhead of these system calls. In ideal
        conditions this will give you RPC as fast as native seL4 IPC. This only
        has an effect on ARM.

    config CAMKES_PROVIDE_TCB_CAPS
    bool "Verification: Provide TCB caps"
    default y
    help
        Hand out TCB caps to components. These caps are used by the component
        to exit cleanly by suspending. Disabling this option leaves components
        with an empty slot in place of their TCB cap. This means they will cap
        fault when attempting to exit. The advantage is that your resulting
        CapDL specification contains no TCB caps and is thus easier to reason
        about.

    config CAMKES_SUPPORT_INIT
    bool "Verification: Support init infrastructure"
    default y
    help
        Support the pre_init, post_init and interface init functions as part of
        component startup. These functions allow extra functionality, but
        introduce some endpoint caps for synchronisation. You probably want
        this option enabled unless you are targetting verification.

    config CAMKES_CONNECTOR_TIMING
    bool "Enable collection of timing data for connectors"
    default n
    help
        Enable timing points within connector templates that take cycle counter
        values as they are passed. This timing data can then be retrieved after
        execution.

    config CAMKES_DEFAULT_PRIORITY
    int "Default thread priority"
    # Default to one less than max prio to avoid interleaving our output with
    # the CapDL initialiser.
    default 254
    range 1 255
    help
        Default priority for component threads if this is not overridden via an
        attribute. Generally you want to set this as high as possible due to
        the suboptimal seL4 scheduler.

    choice
    prompt "Profiler"
    default CAMKES_PROFILER_NONE
    help
        Select the profiling tool to use when instantiating templates. Enabling
        a profiler can help you diagnose performance bottlenecks in the
        compilation process. The available profilers are "internal" (basic
        timing information), "native" (cProfile), "aggregate" (single
        cProfile measurement across entire execution) and "heartbeat" (just a
        debugging print out pulse to show progress).

    config CAMKES_PROFILER_NONE
    bool "none"
    help
        No profiler

    config CAMKES_PROFILER_INTERNAL
    bool "internal"
    help
        Basic profiling of CAmkES functionality. This option gives you a
        summary of time spent in each phase of the CAmkES generator. It can be
        used to determine, at a fairly coarse granularity, which parts of the
        generator's execution are expensive.

    config CAMKES_PROFILER_NATIVE
    bool "native"
    help
        Profiler utilising Python's cProfile module. This option gives you
        comprehensive statistical profiling data per generator phase.

    config CAMKES_PROFILER_AGGREGATE
    bool "aggregate"
    help
        Profiler utilising Python's cProfile module. This option gives you
        comprehensive statistical profiling data aggregated across an entire
        execution of the generator.

    config CAMKES_PROFILER_HEARTBEAT
    bool "heartbeat"
    help
        This option causes the CAmkES generator to periodically output where in
        its source it is currently executing. This is primarily useful for
        debugging infinite loops caused by inadequate input specification checks
        or incorrect template code.

    endchoice

    config CAMKES_PYTHON_OPTIMIZE
    bool "Enable Python optimisations (-O)"
    # Note that you cannot enable -OO (strip docstrings as well) because PLY
    # needs them.
    default n
    help
        Pass -O to Python when running CAmkES. This causes Python to produce
        optimised bytecode that runs significantly faster. Note that this
        option will disable assertions and therefore it is not recommended to
        enable it if you are working on the internals of CAmkES itself.

    config CAMKES_PLY_OPTIMIZE
    bool "Enable PLY optimisations"
    default n
    help
        Run the CAmkES parsing library, PLY, in an optimised configuration.
        With this enabled, docstrings and regexs are compiled during an
        execution and then re-used during following executions rather than
        re-compiling. This option significantly hampers PLY's diagnostics so it
        is not recommended to enable this if you are working on the internals
        of CAmkES itself.

    config CAMKES_DISABLE_PYTHON_IMPORT_CHECKS
    bool "Disable Python import checks"
    default n
    help
        Disable sanity checks that Python modules we are about to import are
        available. These checks are designed to warn new users that they do not
        have the required dependencies. If you have an established installation
        and want to speed up your build times you should select this option.

    choice
    prompt "Python interpreter"
    default CAMKES_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_CPYTHON
    help
        Select the Python interpreter used for executing CAmkES. The default
        CPython interpreter should be acceptable for any normal use, but you
        may find PyPy provides better build system performance under some
        circumstances. To use PyPy, obviously you need it installed. The other
        interpreters are for profiling or dynamic analysis.

    config CAMKES_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_CPYTHON
    bool "CPython (default)"

    config CAMKES_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_PYPY
    bool "PyPy"

    config CAMKES_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_FIGLEAF
    bool "Figleaf"

    config CAMKES_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_COVERAGE
    bool "Coverage"

    endchoice

    config CAMKES_LABEL_MAPPING
    bool "Generate policy label mapping"
    default n
    help
        Enable this option to generate a mapping from labels to kernel objects
        during compilation. A label per-CAmkES entity (component instance or
        connection) is generated and they are intended to form the input domain
        of a function mapping these to final policy labels. The final labels
        are then used to reason about the security properties of a system.
